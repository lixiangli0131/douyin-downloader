# Project Background
1. Market Level
The Booming Development of the Short Video Industry
In recent years, the short video industry has witnessed explosive growth. As a globally renowned short video platform, TikTok (known as Douyin in China) has attracted hundreds of millions of users worldwide with its rich and diverse content and powerful social interaction features. A large number of users browse, create, and share videos on TikTok every day, making it a vast treasure trove of content.
The Increasing Demand for Content Dissemination
With the popularization of short videos, the dissemination and sharing of content have become increasingly important. Whether it is individual users who want to save their favorite videos or enterprises and media institutions that need to obtain high-quality content from TikTok for secondary creation and dissemination, there is a strong demand for convenient download tools.

2. User Level
For individual users, there are many interesting and valuable video contents on TikTok, such as funny skits, food preparation tutorials, and travel landscapes. They hope to save these liked contents to their local devices for easy viewing at any time and sharing with friends. However, the TikTok platform itself does not support batch downloading and watermark removal functions, which brings many inconveniences to users when saving content. 

3. Technical Level 
Advancements in Video Processing Technology
In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in video processing technology. Algorithms for video decoding, encoding, and watermark removal have been continuously optimized and improved. These technological advancements make it possible to develop a tool that can download and remove watermarks from videos efficiently and with high quality.
The Popularization of Mobile Devices
The popularization of smartphones and tablet computers has provided a broad market space for the development and application of TikTok download tools. Users can use the download tool anytime and anywhere on their mobile devices to conveniently and quickly obtain and save TikTok content.

# Introduction to the Main Features of the Project
1. Watermark Removal Features
Video Watermark Removal
It adopts advanced image recognition and processing algorithms to intelligently identify the location and characteristics of watermarks in TikTok videos and accurately remove them. After watermark removal, the video picture is clear and natural, without black edges, blurriness, or other flaws, ensuring the visual enjoyment of the video.

2. Picture Watermark Removal in Albums
For the watermarks on pictures in TikTok albums, the tool can quickly locate and remove them. While removing the watermarks, it protects the key information and details of the photos to ensure the integrity and aesthetics of the pictures.

3. Personalized Features
Custom Settings
It allows users to customize download parameters according to their own needs. For example, users can set the default download path, choose whether to automatically overwrite files with the same name, and adjust the number of download threads. Users can also set batch naming rules, such as naming by video title, release time, or serial number, making file naming more standardized and orderly.
Favorites Function
Users can add videos, albums, and other content of interest to the favorites folder for quick subsequent downloading or viewing. The favorites folder supports classified management. Users can create different favorite folders to classify and store different types of materials.

4. Search and Recommendation Features
Search Function
It provides a powerful search function. Users can search for videos, music, and other content on TikTok through keywords. The search results will display relevant information such as the video title, author, and release time, facilitating users to quickly find the required content.
Recommendation Function
Based on users' download history, browsing records, and collection preferences, it recommends relevant TikTok content to users. The recommended content is updated in real-time, providing users with a personalized content discovery experience and helping them find more videos and music that match their interests.

# Project Advantages

## 🚀 Getting Started <!-- by 李镭雨 -->

### Installation

1. Install Python Dependencies
Navigate to the project root directory in the command line (the directory containing the requirements.txt file) and run the following command to install the required Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you encounter network issues during the installation process that result in slow or failed downloads, you can try using domestic mirror sources, such as Tsinghua University's mirror source:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```
If a Permission denied error occurs (common in Linux and macOS systems), you can add sudo before the command to elevate permissions, but please note that this may require you to enter your system password:
```bash
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Copy Config File：
```bash
cp config.example.yml config.yml
```
If the command prompt does not find the cp command (which may occur in Windows systems), you can manually copy the config.example.yml file and rename it to config.yml, placing it in the project's root directory.

### Configuration

Edit config.yml to set：
- Download URLs
- Save path
- Cookie (from browser DevTools)
Cookie Retrieval Steps:
1.Press F12 → DevTools
2.Go to Application/Storage tab
3.Select "Cookies"
4.Copy target site's cookie names/values

### Execution

**Method 1: Config File (Recommended)**
Enter the project root directory in the command line and execute the following command to run.：
```bash
python DouYinCommand.py
```
During the operation, the tool will automatically download content according to the configuration in the config.yml file.

**Method 2: CLI Arguments**
Enter the project root directory in the command line and execute the following command, where -C True means to enable cookies (which can be omitted if cookies are not needed), -l is followed by the Douyin share link, and -p is followed by the download path.：
```bash
python DouYinCommand.py -C True -l "抖音分享链接" -p "下载路径"
```
​
### Troubleshooting
- Runtime error ModuleNotFoundError: indicates that some Python modules are missing. Confirm whether you have correctly executed 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install the dependencies. If they are already installed, check if the Python environment is correct. You can try recreating and activating the virtual environment, then install the dependencies again.
- Download failed prompt: Cookie is invalid: re-obtain the latest Cookie, ensure that the Cookie has not expired, and make sure there are no missing or extra characters during the copying process.
- Download content is missing or incomplete: Check if there is enough disk space in the save path. If the network is unstable, try reducing the number of threads or downloading in batches.
